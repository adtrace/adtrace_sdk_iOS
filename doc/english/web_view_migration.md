## Migrate your Adjust web bridge SDK to v4.18.2 from v4.18.1 or earlier

Prior to v4.18.2, Adjust web bridge SDK contained methods to inject `UIWebView` objects. To address Apple's warning to developers (ITMS-90809) about `UIWebView` class deprecation, we have removed methods from our bridge which were working with `UIWebView` objects and left only methods which accept `WKWebView` objects.

Removed methods from `AdjustBridge` class:

```objc
- loadUIWebViewBridge:
- loadUIWebViewBridge:webViewDelegate:
```

Please, switch to usage of `WKWebView` in your app instead of `UIWebView` and use following methods instead:

```objc
- loadWKWebViewBridge:
- loadWKWebViewBridge:webViewDelegate:
```

## Migrate your Adjust web bridge SDK to v4.18.1 from v4.9.1 or earlier

### Integration

Before, it was required to manualy drag-and-drop source files into your project to integrate the Adjust web view bridge. One of the main reasons to have to do this, was that we required the Javascript files from Adjust to be used on the view. Now that the Javascript files are injected into the view, it's possible to integrate the Adjust web bridge SDK by using either Cocoapods or Carthage.

Whether you choose to keep the direct source files integration, or use Cocoapods/Carthage, you may remove the Adjust Javascript files you imported previously and their reference from your HTML file(s).

### Adjust config

The Adjust web bridge SDK is now accessing the bridge reference directly by name, so it's no longer necessary to pass
the bridge instance when creating the `AdjustConfig` object. So while previously you would do this:

```js
var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(bridge, yourAppToken, environment);
```

Now you should do:

```js
var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(yourAppToken, environment);
```

We are still detecting the previous API signature to be compatible, but you should change it when migrating.
